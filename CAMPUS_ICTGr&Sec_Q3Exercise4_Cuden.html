		<td bgcolor="#219ebc">Micheal Jordan-He is ranked first in their league. It's also hard to disagree that Jordan had the greatest peak of any GOAT contender and the longest record of top-level accomplishments (as of now). Jordan was a maniacal competitor, which drove him to practice as hard as any NBA player in history in order to have his body in top form to smash opponents.</td>

		<td bgcolor="#219ebc">LeBran James-came into the NBA with unreal expectations and somehow managed to surpass all of them â€“ and then some.James is clutch, he can score at a ridiculous level despite that not being his best attribute, rebounds well and is a fantastic playmaker, his most impressive trait.Few players have ever matched James' absurd basketball IQ, one that he'll use to continue to dominate for the next few seasons as his late prime winds down.If we re-do this exercise in a half-decade, James could very well finish first.</td>

		<td bgcolor="#219ebc">Kareem Abdul-Jabbar- who dominated for almost two decades thanks to his skyhook shot and overall greatness as a scorer, rebounder and shot-blocker.If anything, the longevity argument is still with Abdul-Jabbar, as the all-time big man won his two Finals MVP awards 14 years apart, first in 1971 and then again in 1985.Still, Jordan and James are too tough to overcome, despite Abdul-Jabbar's resume.</td>

			<td bgcolor="#219ebc">Magic Johnson- is one of the greatest basketball point guards in NBA history.The point guard was a vital element of the illustrious "Showtime" generation that helped the Los Angeles Lakers dominate the NBA in the '80s.The Hall of Famer averaged 19.5 points in a game, 11.2 assists, and 7.2 rebounds in 906 games over 13 seasons in his entire career.</td>
